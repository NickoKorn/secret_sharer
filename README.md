The Secret Sharer

University project about "The Secret Sharer: Evaluating and Testing
Unintended Memorization in Neural Networks" Paper. It focuses on Log Perplexities of canaries and the ranks of them. Everything explained in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08232. They are the inventor of the Workflow for "Expsoure"-Metric.

Should work fine for cuda GPU and x86 CPU but Macs MPS is still in progress.

CPU Version should be fine for most reasons because the model is small. Requirements.txt worked for other well.

My setup should work fine: Python3.11.10 on Linux.
